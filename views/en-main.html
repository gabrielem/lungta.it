  	<h2>Help us to maintain the language, culture and customs of Tibet</h2>


<img src="images/home.jpg">

Historically, the hoisting of prayer flags to guarantee good fortune was an event that occurred within the nomadic communities of Tibet, however, this ritual effort has shifted in meaning by having assumed a more religious significance. The design of the flags also endured change as a more religious significance was acquired including the appearance of mantras and images. Auspicious symbols and images of four creatures of significant symbolic value (a garuda, a dragon, a snow lion and a tiger), along with the symbol of good fortune-- theWind horse-- are placed amongst the traditional texts of prayers, invocations and mantras. As the flags are hung, the writings and wishes that are inscribed upon the flag are said to be carried everywhere by the wind, blessings all sentient beings. You can buy as many lungtas as you want, but usually people buy the same number of flags as their years of age.
