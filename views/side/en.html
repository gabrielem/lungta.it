<h2>High quality flags.</h2>
	<p>The flags all are of the most excellent material available, 100% pure cotton, the print is very resistant and the colors are natural.
	</p>

	<h2>The hoisting of the flags in Pharping.</h2>
	<p>
		The flags will be put up in Pharping on Tibetan Losar and we will take pictures of the flags which will be sent to you by email.
	</p>

	<h2>Fly your lungta for Tibetan culture!</h2>
	<p>
		Our aim is to raise money to ensure the continuation of Tibetan culture at a critical time while at the same time giving practitioners the opportunity to buy lungta prayer flags for the upcoming Losar (Tibetan New Year).
		<br><br>

		This is a special and rare opportunity to have one's flags hung up in the very holy place of Pharping, 
		in eastern Nepal and also to contribute money to a worthy cause.
