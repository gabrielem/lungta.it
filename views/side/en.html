	<h2>Shang Shung UK Rare Art Project</h2>
	<p>The Shang Shung Institute UK is documenting a Rare Art Project of the highest quality Tibetan and Nepalese Newari art. Filming will be done by Clive Arrowsmith, a world class photographer and documentary film maker, working very closely with Robert Beer, one of the leading experts on Tibetan and Newari art. Robert also has the most extensive collection of superb Newari art, collected over many years from the most accomplished painters in Nepal. There will also be filming of the artists at work in Nepal through the progress of their work. Robert Beer is not only known for his thangka painting but also wrote The Encylopaedia of Tibetan symbols and Motifs, one of the most authoritative works on the subject, used both by Tibetan and Western artists. In Nepal he is very highly thought of for his expertise and knowledge and is much sought after by the Nepalese and Tibetan artists for his advice and guidance. </p>
