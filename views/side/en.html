<h2>Fly your lungta for Tibetan culture!</h2>
<p>
  Our aim is to raise money to ensure the continuation of Tibetan culture at
  this critical time, while at the same time giving practitioners the
  opportunity to buy lungta prayer flags for the upcoming Losar (Tibetan New
  Year).
  <br /><br />
  This is a special and rare opportunity to have one's flags blessed by a
  spiritual master and hung in the holy place of Pharping, Nepal. Buying flags
  you are contributing towards the activities of the Shang Shung Uk, to see our
  past activities please
