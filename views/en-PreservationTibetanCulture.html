	<h2>Preservation Tibetan Culture</h2>

<b>Tibetan language, culture and customs are under threat</b>.
<br><br>
Throughout Tibet, Chinese language is the lingua franca and is the medium of instruction in educational institutes and at most workplaces.
<br>
The Tibetans living in exile are also driven to forsake their ancestral language in favor of the one spoken in their host country.
<br>
This is a critical moment for Tibetan culture as language is the root of a civilization and the identity of a nation.
<br>
Those of us who have the possibility should do their best to  protect the Tibetan identity by help keeping the language and traditions alive.

<h2>Shang Shung Institute</h2>

In 1989 Chögyal Namkhai Norbu, the spiritual master and former professor of Tibetan and Mongolian studies at the University of Naples L'Orientale, founded the International Shang Shung Institute (ISSI).
<br>
He describes its aim thus:
<br><br>

<i>"The Shang Shung Institute exists for the preservation of Tibetan culture and to translate Tibetan books into Western languages. Through the Shang Shung Institute we are trying to do something to maintain the survival of Tibetan culture and understanding."</i>
<br><br>
The Institute promotes the translation of original Tibetan texts into the major Western languages. It also organizes courses, study seminars, conferences, and exhibitions. It coordinates the publication of numerous books and texts, maintains a modern multimedia documentation center, and offers study grants to worthy young Tibetans.
<br><br>
The Shang Shung Institute UK: London Institute of Tibetan Studies, acts as a forum for Tibetan academic knowledge and facilitates its development through public talks, conferences, short courses and online resources. The UK Institute also offers courses related with Tibetan culture based on the the Five Great Fields of Knowledge such as the Arts, Language, Medicine, Philosophy, Buddhist Studies and Meditation.
